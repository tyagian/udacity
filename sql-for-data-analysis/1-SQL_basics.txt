## ORDER BY is similar to sorting a sheet using a column. A key difference, however, is that using ORDER BY in a SQL query only has temporary effects, for the results of that query, unlike sorting a sheet by column in Excel or Sheets.
The ORDER BY statement always comes in a query after the SELECT and FROM statements, but before the LIMIT statement. If you are using the LIMIT statement, it will always appear last.
Pro Tip
Remember DESC can be added after the column in your ORDER BY statement to sort in descending order, as the default is to sort in ascending order.
SELECT *
FROM demo.orders
LIMIT 1000
